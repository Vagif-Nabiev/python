## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science journey! This repository tracks my progression through key stages essential for becoming proficient in Data Science: Python, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## Stage 1: Fundamentals üßÆ

- Matrices & Linear Algebra: Basics of matrices, vectors, operations, and linear algebra concepts.
- Database Basics: Understanding databases, their structures, and operations.
- Relational vs. Non-relational databases: Differentiating between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.
- SQL + Joins: Learning SQL commands and various types of joins (inner, outer, cross, theta).
- NoSQL: Exploring non-relational databases.
- Tabular Data: Understanding and working with structured data.
- Data Frames & Series: Handling tabular data structures like those in Pandas.
- Extract, Transform, Load (ETL): Processes for extracting, transforming, and loading data.
- Reporting vs. BI vs. Analytics: Differentiating between reporting, business intelligence, and analytics.
- Data Formats: Understanding data formats like JSON, XML, and regular expressions (RegEx).

## Stage 2: Python Basics üì¶
