## Introduction

This repository is a starting point for beginners diving into the world of data science. Together, we'll explore Python programming concepts related to variables, data types, strings, numeric operations, boolean operations.

## Sections

### Variables
- 1. Declare a variable named age and assign it the value 25.
- 2. Can you reassign a variable in Python? Show an example.
- 3. How do you delete a variable in Python?
- 4. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python.
- 5. Create multiple variables, x, y, and z, and assign them the same value in a single line.
- 6. Swap the values of two variables a and b without using a temporary variable.
- 7. What happens if you try to access a variable that hasn't been declared?
- 8. Demonstrate declaring and initializing a variable within a function.
- 9. How can you check if two variables point to the same memory location?
- 10. Explain the purpose of the id() function in Python.

### Data Types
- 1. Name at least five different data types in Python.
- 2. How do you check the data type of a variable in Python?
- 3. Explain type casting or type conversion in Python.
- 4. Convert the integer age into a string and store it in a variable age_str.
- 5. Convert the string "3.14" into a float and store it in a variable pi.
- 6. What is the None data type in Python used for?
- 7. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.
- 8. Give examples of immutable data types in Python.
- 9. Give examples of mutable data types in Python.
- 10. How can you check if a variable is None in Python?

### Strings
- 1. Create a string variable greeting and assign it the value "Hello, World!".
- 2. Find the length of the string "Python is amazing!".
- 3. Extract the word "Python" from the string "Python is versatile!" using string slicing.
- 4. Concatenate the strings "Hello" and "World" into a single string.
- 5. Convert the string "hello" to uppercase.

### Numeric Operations
- 1. Calculate the result of 10 divided by 3 and obtain the remainder.
- 2. Perform exponentiation: raise 5 to the power of 3.
- 3. Find the absolute value of -7.
- 4. Convert the float 3.1416 into an integer.
- 5. Increment a numeric variable count by 1.

### Boolean Operations
- 1. Create a Boolean variable is_valid and set it to True.
- 2. Perform the logical AND operation between True and False.
- 3. Perform the logical OR operation between True and False.
- 4. Negate the value of a Boolean variable flag.
- 5. Check if both x and y are not equal.

### Advanced Concepts
- 1. Explain the concept of dynamic typing in Python.
- 2. How do you check if two variables hold the same value in Python?
- 3. Explain the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python.
- 4. What happens if you assign a value to a variable inside a function without using the 'global' keyword in Python?
- 5. Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in Python.
